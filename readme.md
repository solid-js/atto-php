# Atto PHP Invisible Framework

Atto PHP is the lightweightest PHP stack possible.

### Batteries not included :

- No Composer
- No PSR
- No Doctrine
- No YAML
- No Twig
- No fancy router
- No Cache
- No Libs and no dependencies


### What it does include :

- Dynamic data from URLs with ultra basic routing.
- Some helpers to manage templating, with native PHP commands.
- A way to load data with JSON, to avoid parsing YAML and load libs.
- Multi locale and auto-redirect user to correct locale.
- Secured DB connection thanks to PDO (not a lib, but a widely supported PHP extension).
- Ultra fast rendering thanks to minimal code layers.
- PHP 5.6 backward compatible, it was easy because there is basically nothing to manage.
